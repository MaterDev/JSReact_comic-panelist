So I Made a Comic Panel Creator Tool

Hey everyone!

So this is a bit different from my usual posts, but I wanted to share something I've been working on that combines my love for drawing with my other life as a software engineer.

If you've been following my daily drawings, you've probably noticed I do a lot of comics and sequential art. I'm constantly scribbling in my sketchbook, doing those automatic drawings where I just let the pen flow and find images in the chaos.

I've always been inspired by the panel layout tools in Clip Studio Paint, but I wanted something more focused just on the panel creation process. Something that would let me quickly set up manga-style pages and experiment with different storytelling approaches.

So I built it myself.

What It Does

The Comic Panel Creator is basically a practice tool for comic artists (like me, like you maybe?) who want to improve their storytelling skills without getting bogged down in the technical stuff. It lets you:

Create professional comic panel layouts with proper manga dimensions (5.25 x 7.75 inch)

Generate AI-powered scripts based on your layouts (this part is wild - it actually looks at your panel arrangement and suggests story elements)

Organize your pages into complete books with covers and back covers

Export clean layouts to PDF or PNG for drawing over in whatever app you prefer

It's Open Source & Still in Development!

This project is still actively in development, so expect some rough edges and new features being added regularly. If you're into coding (or just curious), you can check out the project on GitHub: JSReact_comic-panelist (dev branch)

Why I'm Sharing This

I don't usually talk about my software engineering side on this blog, but comics are where my art and tech interests overlap perfectly. This tool has actually helped me with my own daily drawing practice, making it easier to experiment with different panel arrangements and storytelling techniques.

Back to my regular scribbles tomorrow! üñãÔ∏è
