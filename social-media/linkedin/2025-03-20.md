📚 Well, I spent the entire night adding multi-page support to my comic layout app. I'm thrilled to finally complete this task, so I can transition into some quality assurance work.

🔄 It's crazy how much this app idea has evolved in the past couple days. The hardest part was figuring out how to create previews without saving images. I just use the data structure to render nested divs which are relatively placed in the preview box to emulate their positioning.

🧩 Another challenge was handling tracking collections and pages as the user navigates through the interface. The app now lets you organize complete comic books with:

• Front covers, standard pages, and back covers
• Visual thumbnails for quick reference
• Comic spread view (like an actual book!)
• Page deletion with confirmation dialogs
• Automatic page order management

📱 I also completely redesigned the instructions with a dropdown navigation system that makes finding specific information much easier.

What started as a simple panel layout tool has evolved into a complete comic book creation and management system. Can't wait to see what artists create with it!

⚠️ These new features are currently in the dev branch and will be officially available once I get deployment figured out and complete more robust testing. However, feel free to check out the dev branch if you're curious to see what's coming!
