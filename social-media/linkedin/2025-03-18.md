Hey y'all! ðŸ‘‹

I've been fairly quiet lately and focusing on other things outside of engineering, but I wanted to share my latest experimental project.

ðŸ“š An app that lets you create comic book page layouts super easily. Right now it's set up for Manga proportions, but it can be adapted for other sizes too.

ðŸ’¡ Why I built it: I wanted to make it dead simple for comic creators to design layouts and get straight to drawing. Perfect for when you're working on a structured series and need to crank out pages quickly.

Ive been rediscovering my love of comics and re-learning the art after about 7 years of neglecting the skill. So it seemed appropriate to use my engineering skills to help me out. The idea for this approach to structured panel design was heavily inspired by studying the work of Satoshi Kon, one of my favorite Mangaka. (RIP).

âœ¨ Features: 
â€¢ Super simple drag-and-drop interface
â€¢ Adjustable gutters for that perfect spacing 
â€¢ Export straight to PDF - ready for your artwork

ðŸ”— Want to check it out? https://lnkd.in/gUR2Z3B8https://github.com/MaterDev/JSReact_comic-panelist

This is just the start - I've got ideas for more features, but wanted to get this out there. If you're into comics or manga, give it a try! And if you're a dev who wants to contribute or has ideas, hit me up. Would love to see what we can build together.
