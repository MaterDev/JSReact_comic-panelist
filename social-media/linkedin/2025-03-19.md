📘 I'm rediscovering my love for comics lately and thought this would be a fun way to mix AI with comic creation. I wanted to share something cool I added to my comic panel creator app!

🤖 So I hooked it up with Anthropic AI's hashtag#ClaudeAI and now it can actually write comic scripts based on your panel layout! Like, if you make a big dramatic panel, it knows that's probably an important moment and writes it that way. Pretty wild how it picks up on all that stuff.

Basically, now it can help with the actual story- or at least act as a launching point.

Fort this to work there is a server and you will need to supply an Anthropic API key. You can also do this client-side if you're not sure how to add one in the code yourself.

✨ Just pushed a major update to my manga panel creator app! Now you can add creative direction to your AI-generated scripts! 🎨

The new feature lets you specify:
• Genre preferences (fantasy, sci-fi, noir, etc.)
• Emotional tone (suspenseful, humorous, melancholic)
• Inspiration sources (specific artists, films, or styles)
• Content exclusions (things you don't want in your story)

It's like having a creative writing partner who understands exactly what kind of manga story you're trying to tell! The AI adapts to your creative vision while still maintaining the classic Kishōtenketsu narrative structure that works so well for manga storytelling.

📐 Added professional print guidelines with industry-standard color coding (cyan for trim, magenta for safe area) so you can see exactly where your artwork will be trimmed during printing.

🧠 The AI script generation now includes a visual rendering of your panel layout in the prompt, allowing it to understand the spatial relationships between panels (including overlaps) for more accurate storytelling that truly matches your layout intentions.

👾 Panels now include a button that allows you to preview its specific details from its section of the script.

I've also updated the documentation to clarify that this tool is specifically designed for manga dimensions and proportions, making it perfect for aspiring manga artists who want to practice with authentic layouts.

If you're learning manga creation or just want to experiment with AI-assisted storytelling, give it a try! All the code is open source.
